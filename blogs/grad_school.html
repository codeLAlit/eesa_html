            As of July 2020, Anmol Kagrecha is on the verge of completing his B.Tech and M.Tech in
            Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. He has been admitted to the PhD program at the
            Electrical Engineering department at Stanford University and he is also a recipient of the
            Stanford Graduate Fellowship.<br> <hr>
            The article is meant to aid students in the process of applying to PhD programmes. Due to the
            pandemic some of my suggestions might not apply to students who will be applying in 2020. A
            large part of the article is motivated by this amazing ​ <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/" target="_blank">blog post​</a> by Prof. Matt Might.
            <br><br>
            First things first, getting into a reasonable PhD program requires a strong research background.
            Depending on the research area, a certain number of publications are necessary. The art of
            managing research in the undergraduate program will require a separate blog post. Here, the
            aim is to talk about the application process.
            <br><br>
            Most universities require scores of ​ <b>GRE </b>​ and​ <b>TOEFL</b> . I would suggest getting done with GRE
            and TOEFL in summer. These tests require some amount of hardwork in memorizing words and
            writing long essays in a short time. Try to schedule your GRE earlier than TOEFL and within two
            weeks, get done with TOEFL. TOEFL is far easier than GRE but be cautious about the speaking
            section. Tools like Magoosh, Quizlet, and Vocabulary.com might be useful for practice.
            <br><br>
            The next important and time-consuming task is ​<b>preparing a list of professors</b> ​ and therefore,
            the schools you’re interested in. I would suggest applying to a school only if there are at least
            three professors whom you’re interested in working with. Be open to new research areas. It is
            not necessary to continue working on the same problems that you worked on in your
            undergraduate. For example, if you like working on theoretical problems and you worked on
            information theory in your undergraduate, professors working on theoretical problems related to
            optimization, reinforcement learning, blockchains, game theory and of course, information
            theory should be in your radar. Completely changing fields can be tricky but many schools and
            professors are reasonably open-minded.
            <br><br>
            One has to choose which schools to apply to and it requires some strategic decisions to make.
            Firstly,​ <b>apply to schools that you’ll be happy going to</b>. If you only get one admit, ask yourself
            would you be happy going there? If not, then don’t apply. However, being too choosy can lead
            to a situation where one ends up getting no admits. I applied to 9 schools and I wouldn’t have
            regretted going to any one of them. Among the schools I applied to, I would classify 4 of the
            schools as ambitious, 3 as middle, and 2 as safe. However, I’ll reiterate that I would’ve been
            happy going to any of them if I had gotten only one admit.
            <br><br>
            Before filling up the application form, I would recommend that you make a ​ <b>common google
            sheet of PhD applicants</b>, where each applicant fills up their research interests and the schools
            they’re applying to. There is already enough competition, try not to cut each other. Diversify your
            middle and safe school choices and apply to different professors at the top schools. Outrun the
            bear, not each other.
            <br><br>
            Now, I’ll talk about the application materials. Make a ​ <b>three page CV</b> ​ (why? it’s the law!) with a
            focus on your research and course projects. Try not to spend more than half a page on PORs
            and extracurriculars. Get some feedback from your close seniors and polish it up. You will
            typically require ​<b>three recommendation letters</b> ​ for your application. At least two of therecommenders should be professors whom you’ve done research with. Ask them if they’ll be
            able to provide a strong recommendation letter or not. The last recommendation can be from
            someone whom you’ve done a TAship with or with a professor in whose course you performed
            well (AP preferably) or you took a graduate course with (difficult 6xx or 7xx course). A person
            from the industry could be your third recommender but that person should’ve a PhD and should
            be involved in active research.
            <br><br>
            The ​ <b>statement of purpose</b> ​ or SOP is also an important part of your application. The first thing
            to embed in your mind is that you should never read someone else’s SOP before your SOP is in
            good shape. The SOP is meant to convey why you want to do a PhD and shouldn’t be a copy
            of your CV. Try to write a coherent story describing why you got interested in the research
            projects that you worked on and how this motivates you to do a PhD. Get a first draft ready by
            October first week. Ask your seniors to suggest changes and then polish it up. Find more
            information about application materials on the earlier mentioned blog post by Prof. Matt Might.
            <br><br>
            Finally, please be careful with the ​ <b>deadlines</b> . ​ Stanford and Berkeley generally have their
            deadlines earlier. Berkeley also demands something called a personal statement besides the
            SOP. Figure out the details yourselves.
            <br><br>
            Please create a ​ <b>personal webpage</b>. ​ Upload your CV, give descriptions of all the projects that
            you’ve done, even if they’re not on your CV. Provide links to your publications and project
            reports. Professors might get interested in projects that you consider dull or irrelevant.
            Webpages are quite easy to build. This is the template that I had used to make my webpage:
            <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/" target="_blank">Template</a>
            <br><br>
            <b>Apping​ :</b> There are a lot of different opinions on this. Don’t write to a professor if their webpage
            asks you not to. Write only if your work is extremely related to the professor’s work. Apping is an
            arduous process and hardly any emails to professors ever get replied to.
            <br><br>
            <b>Placements​ :</b> There are a lot of different opinions on this. Managing both placements and the
            PhD application process is hard. Application deadlines are nearly parallel to the placement
            dates and I did not sit for the placements. Getting a job in hand is a good safety net but it
            requires considerable effort. I would leave it to you to decide if you want to manage both.
            <br><br>
            Life is hectic till you submit your application but after that, ​ <b>be prepared for waiting and be
            prepared to get emotionally hurt</b>. ​ There is hardly anything you’ll be able to do after submitting.
            The period between submitting your application and finally, hopefully, accepting an admit is
            crazy. It is not uncommon for students to constantly check their emails and an addicting site
            called GradCafe. If you can, keep yourselves busy with recreational activities and take the bare
            minimum course load. I feel it is okay to binge Netflix and go for trips instead of checking
            GradCafe every 5 minutes. You must be thinking that this is not you and you will remain in
            control and you will nail DDP2 or BTP2. Everybody thinks that. Read this paragraph again
            between December and April. Be easy on yourself.
            <br><br>
            Many professors ​ <b>interview</b> ​ students before sending the admits. However, note that interviews
            don’t necessarily convert to admits and not getting interview calls doesn’t mean you can’t get an
            admit. If you do get interview calls, be prepared to explain your projects in detail and answer
            questions put by the professor. Also read at least one paper authored by the professor and
            come up with a question to ask them. Some professors might get into details of coursework and
            this is especially common if you’re not applying to your home department.
            <br><br>
            Always remember that ​ <b>your admits are not solely a function of how good a researcher you
            are</b>. ​ Admits depend on too many things beyond your control and getting an admit to a top
            university doesn’t guarantee success in future endeavors. Stay humble and don’t tie your
            achievements to your ego. I know that it hurts to get rejected and therefore, always have a
            support group to provide you necessary emotional support. Also, stay away from toxic immature
            imbeciles who are too proud of their achievements and have no or little empathy towards others.
            I would like to end by saying that enjoy your application period and accept however things
            unfold.

                <b><large>Program Applied</large></b><br>
                I want to do my Ph.D. in audio signal processing/music information retrieval.
                In the US, I applied to a mixture of Music Technology Ph.D. programs (which
                comes under the departments of music), and EE programs where I saw faculty
                working in signal processing/audio. I was ready to apply to Music programs
                because there were faculty working at the intersection of signal processing/MIR
                and a variety of other interesting topics. However, one thing to be aware of is
                in some departments, Music Ph.D.’s are not considered STEM, so international
                students will not be applicable for the STEM F1-OPT extension (3 years) to
                work after studying, so contact your department and verify this!
                Unlike the US, UK Ph.D.’s don’t guarantee funding with their admissions,
                so you either have to find funding separately (fellowships, scholarships, etc. )
                or pay. Also, the UK Ph.D.’s funding applications expect you to have a detailed
                idea of what you would be working on (research proposal + discussion with
                advisors + rough timeline of your Ph.D.), so pace yourself accordingly. In the
                UK, I applied directly to programs that had funding guaranteed, either through
                fellowship or a scholarship.<br>

                <b><large>General Comments/Thoughts</large></b><br>
                First steps are to give GRE and TOEFL, and get them out of the way. I gave
                GRE and TOEFL in September, within a week of each other. Once done with
                that, start searching for Professors who you would be interested in working
                with. To do this, just go to the university department websites, and check
                out the professors and their research groups. They also often post additional
                information on their websites (do they need new students, what are they working
                on currently etc.)<br>
                I also found it really advantageous to mail the Professor before applying
                and asking them directly if they will be taking new students etc. This serves 2
                purposes: You know that prof is available in case you want to work with him
                and also helps you in selecting schools. If he is not taking students, then you
                might be better off not applying to that school (if no one elses research interests
                you). I found the following links <a href="https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/" target="_blank"><b>1</b></a>

                    Hello Professor XYZ,
                    I’m Krishna, a (current degree) student and I am writing this email
                    to you as a prospective Ph.D. applicant.
                    I’m currently (describe current work in 1 or max 2 lines). I have attached
                    my CV below, which highlights some of my research in (xyz). I’ve also
                    linked my homepage, where you can find more information on my research.
                    I find your work on (xyz) fascinating, and (a sentence indicating that
                    you have read his work or worked on something similar) I also like
                    your work on (something else that interests you) and would love to
                    hear more about graduate opportunities with you.
                    Thank you for your time and, I look forward to hearing from you!
                    Sincerely,
                    Krishna Subramani.

                With the following mail template, I heard back from almost everyone I mailed
                (7 out of 8 places I applied to). Another thing that I felt that helped was
                building a small webpage, where you can describe your research in more detail
                (publications/project reports/code etc). I used Jon Barron’s website <a href="https://jonbarron.info/" target="_blank" ><b>template</b></a>.
                You can use github pages to host your website, or a server if your university
provides one (IITB provides one through bighome)
                <br>
                The next important component is the SOP. This is not the most impor-
                tant part of the application (your research experience, it’s relevance with your
                prospective profs current research and your recommendations are very impor-
                tant). What the SOP does however is highlights your research strengths, and
                allows the department to match you to prospective profs (whom you can name
                in your SOP). Here are two blogs <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/" target="_blank"><b>1</b></a> 
                <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2015/10/how-to-write-a-bad-statement-for-a-computer-science-phd-admissions-application.html" target="_blank"><b>2</b></a> which I found really helpful while drafting
                my own SOPs.
                <br>
                A few more miscellaneous takeaways from my experience:
                <ol>
                    <li>If possible, meet-up faculty if they come to local conferences/university
                        symposiums or talks - I was lucky in this, the professor I wanted to work
                        with at UIUC was in a workshop in India, so I could attend the workshop
                        and talk to him.</li>
                    <li>Talk to graduate students who work with the advisor you want to work
                        with. They can give you a good insight (advising style etc.). Talk to
                        multiple grad students if possible to get a less noisy estimate of the advisor.</li>
                    <li>One potential reason for my rejection from music programs might be my
                        lack of formal music training, which a few schools desire. Also, the Music
                        Technology Ph.D. programs are more competitive than the ECE Ph.D.
                        programs in that they only take 2-3 students every year. So, if you are
                        applying to Music Technology Ph.D. programs, keep all these in mind.</li>
                    <li>For the UK programs, contact the potential advisor beforehand, as they
                        can help you in drafting the research proposal, and they can also help with
                        your application in general.</li>
                </ol>
