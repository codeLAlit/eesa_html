                    “It was a glorious 4-month long vacation!”, I answered, every time a curious eye looked at me
                    expectantly on my homecoming. I could never be more thankful to the fact that the possibility of
                    an exchange powered its way through the sea of opportunities offered at the Institute. The
                    whole idea of traveling abroad without any leash weighing you down was very overwhelming
                    and being a Dual degree student, I couldn’t let this opportunity go. The fascinating exchange
                    stories by a few seniors fuelled me further as I happily set out to prepare for the application
                    procedure.<br><br>
                    Belonging to the Electrical Engineering department, my course mapping was extremely easy as
                    I had a lot of options in nearly every university. Having been to Europe before, I wanted to try
                    some of the top Canadian universities. I had always wanted to see a part of North America
                    which was not the USA(at least that’s what the people without a USA visa say :P). The
                    application procedure was super smooth but the biggest obstacle that I faced was when my
                    Student-Visa got rejected a month before my flight. All my dreams came crashing down when I
                    looked at the rejection mail by the Immigration office of Canada on my phone. I took a chance to
                    reapply and with a lot of support from a few friends and family, I luckily got through - just in the
                    nick of the time.<br><br>
                    Regardless of all the last-minute fiasco, the semester at Toronto started with a blast. The
                    Inbound Exchange Office at the University of Toronto was extremely welcoming and made all
                    the students feel at-home with a series of interactive orientations, dodgeball games, free skating
                    nights, pub-gatherings and what not. Although the University caters to students of all fields(not
                    only Engineering), it had an enigmatic way to tie together a jaw droppingly huge number of
                    students touching almost 1 lakh. The academic workload was definitely easier and the
                    curriculum was more fun than the one followed here. Since I had a lot of time in between my
                    classes, I explored most parts of the University and Toronto during the week. I tried to be as
                    Canadian as I could be, by signing up for Ice-skating classes. It was one of the best decisions
                    as I met some of the sweetest people on earth in the class, which grew into a tightly-knit group
                    of friends. Weekends greeted us with exciting travel-plans and a lot of exhilarating experiences
                    and memories. Owing to the fact that UofT doesn’t have any dormitory system, we were blessed
                    with a lot of house-parties, nostalgic potlucks and merry-making during Candian festivals.<br><br>
                    Canada has been such a heart-warming country, that I couldn’t help but embrace it with
                    unblemished adoration and affection. The charm of the country lies in the simplicity and the
                    flawless temperament of the people. It’s hard to live in Canada and not appreciate the subtlety
                    of life. The intangibile highlight of any exchange lies in the easiness that it brings in you -
                    discovering your own thoughts, engaging in uncomfortable-at-first conversations, saying yes
                    more often than no to opportunities, encouraging self-care, unboxing confidence, tossing away
                    the unspoken flaws and stepping up as a wholesomer You.
